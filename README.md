## Kushina Bot
Kushina Bot is my own bot that I'm currently working on.

## Get Started
To get started you need a IDE 
> [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Make a project file to store your bots file system.

# 0. Important
In the config.json file you need:
- ClientID (application ID)
- GuildID (guild server ID)
- Token (regenerate token for token)
**DO NOT GIVE THESE TO ANYONE**

# 1. Installing NPM
To install NPM you need [node.js](https://nodejs.org).
> **Optional:** Install Additional Tools.  

To open VSCode Terminal do <code>Ctrl + `</code>.
**Make sure that VSCode is in the *Bot Directory* you made earlier.**
Once installed type <code>npm install</code>.
> **Recommended:** Install the update.

Afterwards, type <code>npm init -y</code>.
# 2. Installing <code>discord.js</code>
After installing your *npm packages* type: <code>npm install discord.js</code>.
Then type: <code>npm install -g npm@8.12.2</code>.
If you want building tools you will need *discord.js builders*.
<code>npm install @discordjs/builders @discordjs/rest discord-api-types</code>
